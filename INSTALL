Building jprefctl from source:
------------------------------

First read the attached COPYING file before using this software anywhere. It's
free, but not as in free willy.

In order to install, you need java and ant. Ant is available from
http://ant.apache.org/ .

ant make-clidist :
    This will create a zip file that contains the jar file and the wrapper
    script for running the command line interface. Try './jwordpress -?'
    for a list of command line options.

ant install :
    This will install files to /usr/bin by default, you can change the
    installation prefix by 'ant -Dinstallprefix=(somewhereelse) install'.

There are other ant targets, but I suspect anyone ever needs to use them. Feel
free to browse build.xml and let me know anything bizarre that requires
explanation here.
