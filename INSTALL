Building jwordpress from source:
------------------------------

First read the attached COPYING file before using this software anywhere. It's
free, but not as in free willy.

In order to install, you need java and maven. Maven is available from
http://maven.apache.org/ .

mvn compile:
    This will compile sources to the "target" directory.

mvn package:
    This will create two zip files under the "target" directory.

    jwordpress-VERSION.zip: This one contains the jar file and the wrapper
    script for running the command line interface. Try './jwordpress -?'
    for a list of command line options.

    jwordpress-VERSION-src.zip: This contains the source files, suitable for
    recompilation.

mvn install:
    This will install the jar file and the wrapper to /usr/local. To change
    the prefix use "PREFIX=/usr/somewhereelse mvn install"

mvn javadoc:javadoc:
    This will generate javadocs under doc/ directory.
